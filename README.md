# Real-Time Chat Application – Microservices Architecture

This repository contains a **scalable, event-driven real-time chat application** designed using **clean microservices architecture**. It features JWT authentication, modular services, async communication with RabbitMQ, real-time chat via WebSockets, and a highly extensible deployment strategy using Docker and Kubernetes.

> ⚙️ This project is built for scalability, clarity, and clean separation of concerns—aligned with enterprise standards such as DDD, CQRS, and Clean Architecture.

## 📌 Key Features

- 🔐 **Authentication & Authorization** (JWT, RBAC)
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **User Profiles & Discovery**
- 💬 **1:1 & Group Chat** with real-time support (Socket.IO)
- 📩 **Notifications** (Email, Push via Firebase)
- 🗂 **Modular Microservices** with isolated domains
- 🔄 **Event-Driven Communication** (RabbitMQ)
- 🗃 **Polyglot Persistence** (SQL Server, MongoDB, Redis, InfluxDB)
- ☁️ **Containerized & Orchestrated** via Docker & Kubernetes

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

This system follows a **Domain-Driven Design + Clean Architecture** model. Each service owns its database and communicates asynchronously where possible.

### 🔧 Backend Services

| Service       | Responsibility                          | Tech Stack                    |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Auth Service  | Registration, login, token validation   | ASP.NET Core, SQL Server, JWT |
| User Service  | Profiles, friend management             | ASP.NET Core, MongoDB         |
| Chat Service  | Real-time messaging, channels, DMs      | Node.js, MongoDB, Socket.IO   |
| Notification  | Email, push notifications, preferences  | Node.js, Redis, Firebase      |
| Media Service | File uploads, image optimization        | ASP.NET Core, S3/Azure Blob   |
| WebSocket GW  | Connection handling, event broadcasting | Node.js, Redis Adapter        |
| Analytics     | BI, usage tracking, system metrics      | Python, InfluxDB, PostgreSQL  |

## 📁 Folder Structure

The repo is organized using **Clean Architecture layers**:

- `API Layer`: Controllers, Middleware
- `Core Layer`: Business logic, DTOs, Interfaces
- `Infrastructure`: DB access, event producers/consumers

Each service is a self-contained project with its own API/Core/Infrastructure layers.

📄 Detailed explanation: [`docs/FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md`](./docs/FOLDER_STRUCTURE.md)

## 🔐 API Reference

The Authentication microservice provides endpoints for:

- User Registration & Login
- Token Validation
- Forgot Username/Password flows
- Account Updates (email, username, password)
- JWT Authentication (Bearer Token)

📄 Full API Details: [`docs/API_REFERENCE.md`](./docs/API_REFERENCE.md)

🔐 Example:

```http
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
```
